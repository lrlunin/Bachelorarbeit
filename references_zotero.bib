	abstract = {The photon energy dependence of the mean energy W required to produce an electron-hole pair in silicon for photons with energies between 50 and 1500 {eV} was determined from the spectral responsivity of selected silicon photodiodes. The spectral responsivity was measured with a relative uncertainty of less than 0.3\% using monochromatized synchrotron radiation whose radiant power was measured with a cryogenic electrical substitution radiometer. In order to deduce W from the spectral responsivity of photodiodes with a relative uncertainty of about 1\%, a method for the calculation of photon and electron escape losses from silicon photodiodes was developed and the model for the charge carrier recombination losses was improved. In contrast to recent theoretical and experimental results, a constant value W=(3.66±0.03) {eV} was obtained in the photon energy range from 50 to 1500 {eV}. The present experimental results are confirmed by calculation of the pair creation energy in silicon from data from the literature for the relevant material properties. The difference from previous theoretical work is due to different assumptions about the influence of the band structure of silicon.},

Starting user operation in fall 2017 European {XFEL} will provide new research opportunities to users from science domains as diverse as physics, chemistry, geo- and planetary sciences, materials sciences or biology. The unique feature of European {XFEL} is the provision of high average brilliance in the soft and hard X-ray regime, combined with the pulse properties of {FEL} radiation of extreme peak intensities, femtosecond pulse duration and high degree of coherence. The high average brilliance is achieved through acceleration of up to 27,000 electron bunches per second by the super-conducting electron accelerator. Enabling the usage of this high average brilliance in user experiments is one of the major instrumentation drivers for European {XFEL}. The radiation generated by three {FEL} sources is distributed via long beam transport systems to the experiment hall where the scientific instruments are located side-by-side. The X-ray beam transport systems have been optimized to maintain the unique features of the {FEL} radiation which will be monitored using build-in photon diagnostics. The six scientific instruments are optimized for specific applications using soft or hard X-ray techniques and include integrated lasers, dedicated sample environment, large area high frame rate detector(s) and computing systems capable of processing large quantities of data.},

In this paper, we describe the evolution of the temporal and transverse correlation functions along the undulator length, and we extract the corresponding evolution of coherence time and degree of transverse coherence as typical ﬁgures of merit. Generation of coherent radiation inside the {FEL} undulators is followed by beam transport to the experiments. During transport, the total number of coherent modes is preserved, but the wavefront can be disturbed, and we analyze the conditions under which this occurs. It is emphasized that the development of experimental observables for the degree of coherence and wavefront properties will be important for experiments using coherent x-ray radiation.},

It serves a broad user community active in many scientific fields ranging from atomic and molecular physics to plasma and solid state physics as well as chemistry and biology.

	abstract = {Ultrafast optical pumping of spatially nonuniform magnetic textures is known to induce far-from-equilibrium spin transport effects. Here, we use ultrafast x-ray diffraction with unprecedented dynamic range to study the laser-induced dynamics of labyrinth domain networks in ferromagnetic {CoFe}/Ni multilayers. We detected azimuthally isotropic, odd order, magnetic diffraction rings up to 5th order. The amplitudes of all three diffraction rings quench to different degrees within 1.6 ps. In addition, all three of the detected diffraction rings both broaden by 15\% and radially contract by 6\% during the quench process. We are able to rigorously quantify a 31\% ultrafast broadening of the domain walls via Fourier analysis of the order-dependent quenching of the three detected diffraction rings. The broadening of the diffraction rings is interpreted as a reduction in the domain coherence length, but the shift in the ring radius, while unambiguous in its occurrence, remains unexplained. In particular, we demonstrate that a radial shift explained by domain wall broadening can be ruled out. With the unprecedented dynamic range of our data, our results provide convincing evidence that labyrinth domain structures are spatially perturbed at ultrafast speeds under far-from-equilibrium conditions, albeit the mechanism inducing the perturbations remains yet to be clarified.},

	abstract = {Femtosecond magnetization phenomena have been challenging our understanding for over a decade. Most experiments have relied on infrared femtosecond lasers, limiting the spatial resolution to a few micrometres. With the advent of femtosecond X-ray sources, nanometric resolution can now be reached, which matches key length scales in femtomagnetism such as the travelling length of excited 'hot' electrons on a femtosecond timescale. Here we study laser-induced ultrafast demagnetization in [Co/Pd]30 multilayer films, which, for the first time, achieves a spatial resolution better than 100 nm by using femtosecond soft X-ray pulses. This allows us to follow the femtosecond demagnetization process in a magnetic system consisting of alternating nanometric domains of opposite magnetization. No modification of the magnetic structure is observed, but, in comparison with uniformly magnetized systems of similar composition, we find a significantly faster demagnetization time. We argue that this may be caused by direct transfer of spin angular momentum between neighbouring domains.},

	abstract = {During ultrafast demagnetization of a magnetically ordered solid, angular momentum has to be transferred between the spins, electrons, and phonons in the system on femto- and picosecond timescales. Although the intrinsic spin-transfer mechanisms are intensely debated, additional extrinsic mechanisms arising due to nanoscale heterogeneity have only recently entered the discussion. Here we use femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser to study thin film samples with magnetic domain patterns. We observe an infrared-pump-induced change of the spin structure within the domain walls on the sub-picosecond timescale. This domain-topography-dependent contribution connects the intrinsic demagnetization process in each domain with spin-transport processes across the domain walls, demonstrating the importance of spin-dependent electron transport between differently magnetized regions as an ultrafast demagnetization channel. This pathway exists independent from structural inhomogeneities such as chemical interfaces, and gives rise to an ultrafast spatially varying response to optical pump pulses.},

	abstract = {The evolution of a magnetic domain structure upon excitation by an intense, femtosecond infrared ({IR}) laser pulse has been investigated using single-shot based time-resolved resonant x-ray scattering at the x-ray free electron laser {LCLS}. A well-ordered stripe domain pattern as present in a thin {CoPd} alloy film has been used as a prototype magnetic domain structure for this study. The fluence of the {IR} laser pump pulse was sufficient to lead to an almost complete quenching of the magnetization within the ultrafast demagnetization process taking place within the first few hundreds of femtoseconds following the {IR} laser pump pulse excitation. On longer time scales this excitation gave rise to subsequent irreversible transformations of the magnetic domain structure. Under our specific experimental conditions, it took about 2 ns before the magnetization started to recover. After about 5 ns the previously ordered stripe domain structure had evolved into a disordered labyrinth domain structure. Surprisingly, we observe after about 7 ns the occurrence of a partially ordered stripe domain structure reoriented into a novel direction. It is this domain structure in which the sample's magnetization stabilizes as revealed by scattering patterns recorded long after the initial pump-probe cycle. Using micromagnetic simulations we can explain this observation based on changes of the magnetic anisotropy going along with heat dissipation in the film.},

	abstract = {Sub-picosecond magnetisation manipulation via femtosecond optical pumping has attracted wide attention ever since its original discovery in 1996. However, the spatial evolution of the magnetisation is not yet well understood, in part due to the difficulty in experimentally probing such rapid dynamics. Here, we find evidence of a universal rapid magnetic order recovery in ferrimagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy via nonlinear magnon processes. We identify magnon localisation and coalescence processes, whereby localised magnetic textures nucleate and subsequently interact and grow in accordance with a power law formalism. A hydrodynamic representation of the numerical simulations indicates that the appearance of noncollinear magnetisation via optical pumping establishes exchange-mediated spin currents with an equivalent 100\% spin polarised charge current density of 107 A cm−2. Such large spin currents precipitate rapid recovery of magnetic order after optical pumping. The magnon processes discussed here provide new insights for the stabilization of desired meta-stable states.},

	abstract = {During ultrafast demagnetization of a magnetically ordered solid, angular momentum has to be transferred between the spins, electrons, and phonons in the system on femto- and picosecond timescales. Although the intrinsic spin-transfer mechanisms are intensely debated, additional extrinsic mechanisms arising due to nanoscale heterogeneity have only recently entered the discussion. Here we use femtosecond X-ray pulses from a free-electron laser to study thin film samples with magnetic domain patterns. We observe an infrared-pump-induced change of the spin structure within the domain walls on the sub-picosecond timescale. This domain-topography-dependent contribution connects the intrinsic demagnetization process in each domain with spin-transport processes across the domain walls, demonstrating the importance of spin-dependent electron transport between differently magnetized regions as an ultrafast demagnetization channel. This pathway exists independent from structural inhomogeneities such as chemical interfaces, and gives rise to an ultrafast spatially varying response to optical pump pulses.},

	rights = {info:eu-repo/semantics/{openAccess}},
	url = {http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/handle/11682/6705},
	doi = {10.18419/opus-6688},
	abstract = {Fe/Gd multilayers with monolayer and submonolayer thicknesses have been systematically studied on flat substrates and on self-assembled nanospheres with high spatial resolution. A series of Fe/Gd multilayers consisting of 75 bilayers have been prepared on flat silicon substrate with sublayer thicknesses from 0.36 to 0.60 nm. A thickness dependent spin reorientation transition ({SRT}) from an in-plane to a perpendicularly magnetized state is observed by decreasing the sublayer thickness. These results are quantitatively explained by the contribution of the stray field and by the dipolar pair ordering model. From transmission electron microscopy ({TEM}) analysis it has been seen that inhomogeneous interfaces cause an in-plane magnetization, whereas almost homogeneous interfaces lead to a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ({PMA}). The layer thickness (total thickness), preparation techniques, and the choice of the substrate also have a strong influence on magnetic properties of the system.

    The domain configuration during a temperature driven {SRT} is studied by photoemission electron microscopy ({PEEM}). A sample with the composition 75×[Fe (0.36 nm)/Gd (0.36 nm)]  initially shows an in-plane magnetization at room temperature and upon heating the sample, the in-plane domains change to a maze like, perpendicular domains. Between these transformations, a coexistence of in-plane and out-of-plane domain configurations is seen in a broad temperature range of 57° - 81° C. Micromagnetic simulations reproduced a similar coexistence phase. The presence of two local minima in the total energy, due to the different temperature behaviors of the surface anisotropy ({KS}) and the volume anisotropy ({KV} ) is believed to cause this coexistence phase. After several {SRT} cycles the perpendicular state of the sample became more prominent at room temperature. {TEM} images recorded before and after annealing show significant changes in the layered structure. This infers that the chemical and structural changes in the sample upon annealing are responsible for the appearance of {PMA}.

Upon depositing Fe/Gd multilayers on self-assembled silica or polystyrene nanospheres a new class of magnetic nanostructures with a crescent shaped cross section is produced. The influence of the thickness gradient and the curved nature of the substrate on the properties of the magnetic multilayers are studied with respect to the diameter of the spheres and the thickness of the films. A 36 nm Fe/Gd film with a composition of 50×[Fe (0.36 nm)/Gd (0.36 nm)] has been deposited on nanospheres with diameters of 800, 330, and 160 nm. Upon increasing the diameter of the spheres to 800 nm a dramatic change in the spin structure and the reversal mechanism is observed. Local hysteresis loops of the spherules, deduced from scanning transmission x-ray microscopy ({STXM}) images reveal an S-shaped loop for 800 nm spherules, while for the 330 and 160 nm spherules a squared loop with a sharp switching field accompanied by a change in the magnetic anisotropy from radial to uniaxial is observed. The exchange energy that favors the parallel alignment of the spins overcomes the radial anisotropy and leads to such parallel orientation of the moments upon decreasing the diameter of the sphere. The hysteresis loops and the reversal mechanism obtained by simulation are in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, element selective hysteresis loops on 330 and 160 nm spherules show an asymmetric behavior at Fe and Gd edges. At the maximum field of about 400 Oe Gd moments align with the field direction, whereas Fe moments tilt away from the field direction. These changes suggest a twisted magnetic state due to the increase in the curvature and the magnetic field.

   Furthermore, the thickness dependence of the magnetic properties is addressed. Spherules with a 36 nm thick Fe/Gd film, i.e. 50 bilayers, show an S-shaped loop. Spherules of same diameter of 800 nm but with 75 bilayers system show a squared loop with prominent steps and a strong increase in the coercive field by a factor of four. Magnetization reversal takes place through an intermediate flower state that shows up as a step in the hysteresis loop. This thickness dependent reversal mechanism is explained by the interplay between the different anisotropy terms and the thickness dependent switching field. Similar changes are not observed for the films deposited on a flat substrate. 

  A shape induced {SRT} is observed for an in-plane magnetized Fe/Gd film deposited on nanospheres. A hard axis loop is observed on a flat substrate, whereas the film on spherules with a diameter of 800 nm showed a rectangular easy axis loop. This is explained by the change in the shape anisotropy. 

 In addition to Fe/Gd system, Co/Pt multilayer system is also studied with high spatial resolution. The thickness gradient on the spheres is used to induce a thickness dependent {SRT} locally on every nanospheres. {STXM} images measured in an in-plane and an out-of-plane geometry reveal two different magnetic states at the rim and at the center of the spherules. Local hysteresis loops deduced on a \&\#8776; 50 nm scale show a transformation of the magnetization curve from an easy axis loop to a hard axis loop with increasing the elevation angle on the spheres. The {SRT} from perpendicular to in-plane magnetization has been seen in the interval 56° {\textless} \&\#952; {\textless} 70° within a distance of less than 90 nm. These results are in good agreement with micromagnetic simulations.},

	abstract = {Ferromagnetic materials exhibit intrinsic `easy' and `hard' directions of the magnetization. This magnetic anisotropy is, from both a technological and fundamental viewpoint one of the most important properties of magnetic materials. The magnetic anisotropy in metallic magnetic multilayers forms the subject of this review article. As individual layers in a multilayer stack become thinner, the role of interfaces and surfaces may dominate that of the bulk: this is the case in many magnetic multilayers, where a perpendicular interface contribution to the magnetic anisotropy is capable of rotating the easy magnetization direction from in the film plane to perpendicular to the film plane. In this review, we show that the (in-plane) volume and (perpendicular) interface contribution to the magnetic anisotropy have been separated into terms related to mechanical stresses, crystallographic structure and the planar shape of the films. In addition, the effect of roughness, often inherent to the deposition techniques used, has been addressed theoretically. Several techniques to prepare multilayers and to characterize their growth as well as methods to determine the magnetic anisotropy are discussed. A comprehensive survey of experimental studies on the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in metallic multilayers containing Fe, Co or Ni is presented and commented on. Two major subjects of this review are the extrinsic effects of strain, roughness and interdiffusion and the intrinsic effect of the crystallographic orientation on the magnetic anisotropy. Both effects are investigated with the help of some dedicated experimental studies. The results of the orientational dependence studies are compared with ab initio calculations. Finally, the perpendicular surface anisotropy and the in-plane step anisotropy are discussed.},

	abstract = {{MÖNCH} is a 25 µm-pitch charge-integrating detector aimed at exploring the limits of current hybrid silicon detector technology. The small pixel size makes it ideal for high-resolution imaging. With an electronic noise of about 110 {eV} r.m.s., it opens new perspectives for many synchrotron applications where currently the detector is the limiting factor, e.g. inelastic X-ray scattering, Laue diffraction and soft X-ray or high-resolution color imaging. Due to the small pixel pitch, the charge cloud generated by absorbed X-rays is shared between neighboring pixels for most of the photons. Therefore, at low photon fluxes, interpolation algorithms can be applied to determine the absorption position of each photon with a resolution of the order of 1 µm. In this work, the characterization results of one of the {MÖNCH} prototypes are presented under low-flux conditions. A custom interpolation algorithm is described and applied to the data to obtain high-resolution images. Images obtained in grating interferometry experiments without the use of the absorption grating G2 are shown and discussed.

In the first phase thirteen insertion devices are foreseen. In this paper the principle layout of the machine will be presented. The structure of the new machine combines properties of conventional storage rings and light sources and is therefore quite unconventional. One of the major challenges of the project is to achieve the small emittances. The basic idea is to use so called damping wigglers with a total length of 80 m to reduce the horizontal emittance to the desired level. To obtain and maintain the small emittances imposes tight tolerances on spurious dispersion and orbit quality and stability. These limits will be given and discussed.},

	abstract = {We describe experimental and theoretical investigations of the magnetic domain formation and the ﬁeld reversal behavior in antiferromagnetically coupled perpendicular anisotropy multilayers that mimic A-type antiferromagnet ({AF}) structures. The samples are sputter deposited Co/Pt multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy that are periodically interleaved with Ru to mediate an antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange. This structure allows precise tuning of the different magnetic energy terms involved. Using various magnetometry and magnetic imaging techniques as well as resonant soft X-ray scattering we provide a comprehensive study of the remanent and demagnetized conﬁgurations as well as the corresponding reversal mechanisms. We ﬁnd that adding {AF} exchange to perpendicular anisotropy system alters the typical energy balance that controls magnetic stripe domain formation, thus resulting in two competing reversal modes for the composite system. In the {AF}-exchange dominated regime the magnetization is ferromagnetically ordered within the ﬁlm plane with the magnetization of adjacent layers anti-parallel thus minimizing the interlayer {AF} exchange energy. In the dipolar dominated regime the magnetization pattern forms ferromagnetic ({FM}) stripe domains where adjacent layers are vertically correlated, but laterally anti-correlated thus minimizing the dipolar energy at the expense of the {AF} interlayer coupling. By tuning the layer thickness or applying a magnetic ﬁeld, we observed the co-existence of {AF} domains and {FM} stripe domains. We ﬁnd that a {FM} phase exists at {AF} domain boundaries, causing complex mesoscopic domain patterns with surprising reversibility during minor loop ﬁeld cycling.},

The multilayer structure was sputtered on a transparent glass substrate which made it possible to perform {MOKE} measurements on both Fe and Gd terminated sides of the superlattice. These experiments allowed us to detect a transition between ﬁeld-aligned and canted magnetic states on both sides of the ﬁlm and to distinguish between the bulk and surface twisted phases of the superlattice. As a result, the experimental H − T magnetic phase diagram of the system was obtained. {FMR} studies at frequencies 7 − 36 {GHz} demonstrated a complex evolution of absorption spectra as temperature decreased from room down to 4 K. Two spectral branches were detected in the sample.

	doi = {10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108031},
	abstract = {The udkm1Dsim toolbox is a collection of Python classes and routines to simulate the thermal, structural, and magnetic dynamics after laser excitation as well as the corresponding X-ray scattering response in one-dimensional samples, such as multilayers. The toolbox provides the capabilities to define arbitrary layered structures on the atomic level including a rich database of element-specific physical properties. The excitation of dynamics is represented by an N-temperature-model which is commonly applied in ultrafast physics. Structural dynamics due to thermal stresses are calculated by a linear-chain model of masses and springs. The implementation of specific magnetic dynamics can be easily accomplished by the user employing a generalized magnetization interface class. The resulting X-ray diffraction response is computed by kinematical or dynamical X-ray theory which can also include polarization-dependent magnetic scattering. The udkm1Dsim toolbox is highly modular and allows for injecting user-defined inputs at any step within the simulation procedure.

Program Title: udkm1Dsim {CPC} Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/bnzw823v6y.1 Developer's repository link: https://github.com/dschick/udkm1Dsim Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/8131941 Licensing provisions: {MIT} Programming language: Python Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Commun. 185 (2) (February 2014) 651–660 Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Reasons for the new version: The toolbox has been ported from {MATLAB} ({MathWorks} Inc.) to Python and is based exclusively on free and open-source components. Moreover, new features have been added that allow for a broader applicability of the toolbox. Summary of revisions: Porting to Python. Introduction of amorphous layers in the sample structures. Add magnetization property to atoms and layers. Multilayer formalism to calculate laser absorption. New magnetization class to allow for user-defined magnetization dynamics. New resonant magnetic X-ray scattering employing dynamical X-ray theory. Calculation of X-ray scattering as function of photon energy and scattering vector. Nature of problem: Simulate the thermal, structural, and magnetic dynamics of 1D layered sample structures due to an ultrafast laser excitation and compute the corresponding transient (magnetic) X-ray scattering response. Solution method: The program provides an object-oriented toolbox for building arbitrary layered 1D crystalline/amorphous sample structures including a rich database of element-specific parameters. The excitation, thermal transport, and lattice dynamics are simulated utilizing {SciPy}'s {ODE} solver. Magnetization dynamics can be introduced by the user employing a magnetization interface class. The dynamical (magnetic) X-ray scattering is computed by a matrix formalism that can be parallelized. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: The program is restricted to 1D layered sample structures. Phonon dynamics only include longitudinal acoustic phonons (sound waves). Magnetization dynamics have to be defined by the user. X-ray scattering only allows for symmetrical and co-planar geometries due to the 1D nature of the toolbox. The program is highly modular and allows the inclusion of user-defined inputs at any time of the simulation procedure.},

So far, the application of this photon-demanding technique was limited to large-scale facilities. However, upgrades to diffraction-limited storage rings supporting only x-ray pulses beyond 100 ps, and the shift of x-ray free-electron lasers toward attosecond pulses aggravate the competition for beamtime in the picosecond time window, which is of utmost relevance for magnetism research. Here we present the development of a lab-based instrument providing sufficient photon flux up to 1.5 {keV} photon energy covering the soft-x-ray resonances of transition and rare-earth metal atoms. Our setup features the mandatory tunability in energy and reciprocal space in combination with sub-10 ps temporal resolution, exploiting the broadband emission of a laser-driven plasma x-ray source, which is monochromatized to about 1 {eV} bandwidth by a reflection zone plate. We benchmark our approach against accelerator-based soft-x-ray sources by simultaneously probing the laser-induced magnetic and structural dynamics from an antiferromagnetically coupled Fe/Cr superlattice. Our development lays the foundation for laser-driven resonant scattering experiments to study ultrafast ordering phenomena of charges, spins, and orbitals.},

	abstract = {X-ray free electron lasers, with their ultrashort highly coherent pulses, opened up the opportunity of probing ultrafast nano- and atomic-scale dynamics in amorphous and disordered material systems via speckle visibility spectroscopy. However, the anticipated count rate in a typical experiment is usually low. Therefore, visibility needs to be extracted via photon statistics analysis, i.e., by estimating the probabilities of multiple photons per pixel events using pixelated detectors. Considering the realistic X-ray detector responses including charge cloud sharing between pixels, pixel readout noise, and gain non-uniformity, speckle visibility extraction relying on photon assignment algorithms are often computationally demanding and suffer from systematic errors. In this paper, we present a systematic study of the commonly-used algorithms by applying them to an experimental data set containing small-angle coherent scattering with visibility levels ranging from below 1\% to ∼60\%. We also propose a contrast calibration protocol and show that a computationally lightweight algorithm can be implemented for high-speed correlation evaluation.},

Using simulated detector data, this work provides a detailed analysis of the systematic errors of several contrast extraction algorithms in the context of low-count-rate X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy and their origins are discussed. Here, it was found that the finite detector charge cloud and pixel size lead to an unavoidable `degeneracy' in photon position determination, and that the contrasts extracted using different algorithms can all be corrected by a simple linear model. The results suggest that experimental calibration of the correction coefficient at the count rate of interest is possible and essential.

Here, we utilize coherent X-ray pulses to investigate the sub-100 fs equilibrium dynamics of water from ambient conditions down to supercooled temperatures. This novel approach utilizes the inherent capability of X-ray speckle visibility spectroscopy to measure equilibrium intermolecular dynamics with lengthscale selectivity, by measuring oxygen motion in momentum space. The observed decay of the speckle contrast at the first diffraction peak, which reflects tetrahedral coordination, is attributed to motion on a molecular scale within the first 120 fs. Through comparison with molecular dynamics simulations, we conclude that the slowing down upon cooling from 328 K down to 253 K is not due to simple thermal ballistic-like motion, but that cage effects play an important role even on timescales over 25 fs due to hydrogen-bonding.},

	abstract = {X-ray photon fluctuation spectroscopy using a two-pulse mode at the Linac Coherent Light Source has great potential for the study of quantum fluctuations in materials as it allows for exploration of low-energy physics. However, the complexity of the data analysis and interpretation still prevent recovering real-time results during an experiment, and can even complicate post-analysis processes. This is particularly true for high-spatial resolution applications using {CCDs} with small pixels, which can decrease the photon mapping accuracy resulting from the large electron cloud generation at the detector. Droplet algorithms endeavor to restore accurate photon maps, but the results can be altered by their hyper-parameters. We present numerical modeling tools through extensive simulations that mimic previous x-ray photon fluctuation spectroscopy experiments. By modification of a fast droplet algorithm, our results demonstrate how to optimize the precise parameters that lift the intrinsic counting degeneracy impeding accuracy in extracting the speckle contrast. These results allow for an absolute determination of the summed contrast from multi-pulse x-ray speckle diffraction, the modus operandi by which the correlation time for spontaneous fluctuations can be measured.},

	abstract = {Understanding electronic structure at the nanoscale is crucial to untangling fundamental physics puzzles such as phase separation and emergent behavior in complex magnetic oxides. Probes with the ability to see beyond surfaces on nanometer length and subpicosecond time scales can greatly enhance our understanding of these systems and will undoubtedly impact development of future information technologies. Polarized X-rays are an appealing choice of probe due to their penetrating power, elemental and magnetic specificity, and high spatial resolution. The resolution of traditional X-ray microscopes is limited by the nanometer precision required to fabricate X-ray optics. Here we present a novel approach to lensless imaging of an extended magnetic nanostructure, in which a scanned series of dichroic coherent diffraction patterns is recorded and numerically inverted to map its magnetic domain configuration. Unlike holographic methods, it does not require a reference wave or precision optics. In addition, it enables the imaging of samples with arbitrarily large spatial dimensions, at a spatial resolution limited solely by the coherent X-ray flux, wavelength, and stability of the sample with respect to the beam. It can readily be extended to nonmagnetic systems that exhibit circular or linear dichroism. We demonstrate this approach by imaging ferrimagnetic labyrinthine domains in a Gd/Fe multilayer with perpendicular anisotropy and follow the evolution of the domain structure through part of its magnetization hysteresis loop. This approach is scalable to imaging with diffraction-limited resolution, a prospect rapidly becoming a reality in view of the new generation of phenomenally brilliant X-ray sources.},

	abstract = {{MÖNCH}, a charge integrating readout {ASIC} (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) prototype with a pixel pitch of 25 μm developed at {PSI}, allows new imaging applications in the field of micron resolution and spectral imaging. The small pixel size of this system facilitates charge sharing between pixels, which then can be exploited to gain additional information about the photon absorption position and photon energy. However, for reconstructing complete images from this information, sufficient hits need to be recorded and therefore acquisition times are potentially long. We present a fast read-out system, that is capable of acquiring enough statistics for an image in a few hours in combination with a position reconstruction algorithm, which has the potential to run in a similar amount of time on a fast computing node. We further present results of experiments with a comparable strip detector (small-pitch {GOTTHARD} system) showing that with the aid of single photon interpolation algorithms micron resolution is achievable. Additionally, we show that a similar position reconstruction algorithm works in the two dimensional case for {MÖNCH}.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous retrieval of x-ray attenuation, phase, and scattering using multimodal imaging techniques is finding increasing use in a range of applications, from medicine to materials science. Most techniques rely on the mechanical movement of an optical element (e.g., a grating or a mask) to obtain the multimodal images. While single-shot approaches exist, they typically employ detector pixels smaller than the grating period, often with low detection efficiency, and are limited in resolution unless either the sample or the optical element is displaced in various positions and multiple frames are collected. In this paper, we replace mechanical motion with the {MÖNCH} detector's capability to reach sub-pixel resolutions by interpolating between neighboring pixels collecting the charge generated by a single x-ray event. This enabled us to obtain the pilot demonstration of a laboratory-based high-resolution, single-shot multimodal imaging technique capable of simultaneously retrieving attenuation, directional differential phase, and scatter images, without any mechanical movement. We show that our proof-of-concept setup enables a single-shot resolution of 19.5 
𝜇m
μm
 and that the resulting images provide sufficient information to produce a reliable sample thickness map. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the setup is capable of producing single-shot directional scattering images, while leaving open the option to further increase the resolution by using sample dithering.},

Longitudinal studies following the cause of a disease or evaluating treatment efficacy are of particular interest but challenging due to the small size of the mouse lung and the fast breathing rate. Synchrotron-based in-line phase-contrast computed tomography imaging has been successfully applied in lung research in various applications, but mostly at dose levels that forbid longitudinal in vivo studies. Here, the novel charge-integrating hybrid detector {MÖNCH} is presented, which enables imaging of mouse lungs at a pixel size of 25 µm, in less than 10 s and with an entrance dose of about 70 {mGy}, which therefore will allow longitudinal lung disease studies to be performed in mouse models.},

	abstract = {{MÖNCH} is a hybrid silicon pixel detector based on charge integration and with analog readout, featuring a pixel size of 25×25 μm2. The latest working prototype consists of an array of 400×400 identical pixels for a total active area of 1×1 cm2. Its design is optimized for the single photon regime. An exhaustive characterization of this large area prototype has been carried out in the past months, and it confirms an {ENC} in the order of 35 electrons {RMS} and a dynamic range of ∼4×12 {keV} photons in high gain mode, which increases to ∼100×12 {keV} photons with the lowest gain setting. The low noise levels of {MÖNCH} make it a suitable candidate for X-ray detection at energies around 1 {keV} and below. Imaging applications in particular can benefit significantly from the use of {MÖNCH}: due to its extremely small pixel pitch, the detector intrinsically offers excellent position resolution. Moreover, in low flux conditions, charge sharing between neighboring pixels allows the use of position interpolation algorithms which grant a resolution at the micrometer-level. Its energy reconstruction and imaging capabilities have been tested for the first time at a low energy beamline at {PSI}, with photon energies between 1.75 {keV} and 3.5 {keV}, and results will be shown.},

	abstract = {{PSI} is developing several new detector families based on charge integration and analog readout ({CI}) to respond to the needs of X-ray free electron lasers ({XFELs}), where a signal up to ∼ 104 photons impinging simultaneously on a pixel make single photon counting detectors unusable. {MÖNCH} is a novel hybrid silicon pixel detector where {CI} is combined with a challengingly small pixel size of 25 × 25 μm2. {CI} enables the detector to process several incoming photon simultaneously in {XFEL} applications. Moreover, due to the small pixel size, the charge produced by an impinging photon is often shared. In low flux experiments the analog information provided by single photons can be used either to obtain spectral information or to improve the position resolution by interpolation. Possible applications are resonant and non-resonant inelastic X-ray scattering or X-ray tomography with X-ray tubes. Two prototype {ASICs} were designed in {UMC} 110 nm technology. {MÖNCH}01 contains only some test cells used to assess technology performance and make basic design choices. {MÖNCH}02 is a fully functional, small scale prototype of 4 × 4 mm2, containing an array of 160 × 160 pixels. This array is subdivided in five blocks, each featuring a different pixel architecture. Two blocks have statically selectable preamplifier gains and target synchrotron applications. In low gain mode they should provide single photon sensitivity (at 6-12 {keV}) as well as a reasonable dynamic range for such a small area ( {\textgreater} 120 photons). In high gain they target high resolution, low flux experiments where charge sharing can be exploited to reach μm resolution. Three other architectures address possible uses at {XFELs} and implement automatic switching between two gains to increase the dynamic range, as well as input overvoltage control. The paper presents the {MÖNCH} project and first results obtained with the {MÖNCH}02 prototype.},

	abstract = {{MÖNCH} is a 25 µm-pitch charge-integrating detector aimed at exploring the limits of current hybrid silicon detector technology. The small pixel size makes it ideal for high-resolution imaging. With an electronic noise of about 110 {eV} r.m.s., it opens new perspectives for many synchrotron applications where currently the detector is the limiting factor, e.g. inelastic X-ray scattering, Laue diffraction and soft X-ray or high-resolution color imaging. Due to the small pixel pitch, the charge cloud generated by absorbed X-rays is shared between neighboring pixels for most of the photons. Therefore, at low photon fluxes, interpolation algorithms can be applied to determine the absorption position of each photon with a resolution of the order of 1 µm. In this work, the characterization results of one of the {MÖNCH} prototypes are presented under low-flux conditions. A custom interpolation algorithm is described and applied to the data to obtain high-resolution images. Images obtained in grating interferometry experiments without the use of the absorption grating G2 are shown and discussed. Perspectives for the future developments of the {MÖNCH} detector are also presented.},
